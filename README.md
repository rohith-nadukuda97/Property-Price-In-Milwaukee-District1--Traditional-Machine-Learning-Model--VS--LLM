# Property Prices in Milwaukee District 1

## Introduction  
The effectiveness of **large language models (LLMs)** in structured data analysis has sparked debate. While LLMs excel at handling unstructured data—such as PDFs and text—they are often perceived as inferior to traditional **machine learning models** for tasks like **price prediction**.

To explore this comparison, Milwaukee District 1 serves as our case study. The analysis incorporates datasets related to:  
- **House prices**  
- **Crime statistics**  
- **Proximity to public transport**  

The objective is to evaluate whether predictions generated by LLMs align with those produced by machine learning models or exhibit noticeable differences. This study aims to determine if LLMs can **compete with traditional models** for structured data tasks or if their strengths lie elsewhere.
